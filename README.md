### WASH Benefits Bangladesh Analysis on the Effects of Intervention on Child Stress and Methylation Outcomes

This is the repository for the WASH Benefits Bangladesh [NCT01590095](#https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01590095) interventions on child stress substudy. The primary analysis assessed the associations between telomere length as the exposure and various measures of growth such as length-for-age Z-score as outcomes. Post hoc analyses were conducted to examine the associations in the opposite direction. This repository contains scripts for both the primary and post hoc analyses as well as for generating tables and figures.

### Associated protocols and datasets
The pre-specified analysis plan and the data required for the analysis will be available through the Open Science Framework: [https://osf.io/9snat/](https://osf.io/9snat/).

### WASH Benefits Package
This analysis requires [washb](https://github.com/ben-arnold/washb), a package developed for WASH Benefits analyses. 

For all scripts, you will need to change directory statements to reflect locations of files within your local directory. Changes will also need to be made to directory statements when saving output files such as results, tables, and figures.
